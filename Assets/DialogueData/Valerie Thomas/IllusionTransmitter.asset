  dialogue:
  - You see that big machine in the corner there?
  - That is the illusion transmitter, I patented it in 1980.
  - It is the first ever 3D device, projecting what is in simple terms a hologram.
  - It does this by using concave mirrors, and transmitting an image through the
    lens.
  - This machine pioneered most future 3D technology.
