  dialogue:
  - You mean the spacepen? That is actually something I did not personally work on.
  - It is simply an interesting piece of NASA history. It costed about 1 milion dollars
    to design it.
  - It was needed because pens didn't work in space, and pencils spread too much
    dust.
  - The Fisher spacepen is able to write in zero gravity, and even on surfaces like
    glass.
