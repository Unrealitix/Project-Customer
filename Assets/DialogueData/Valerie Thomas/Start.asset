  dialogue:
  - Hello! Welcome to one of the many NASA testing rooms.
  - My name is Valerie Thomas.
  - I worked at NASA in the 1970's, on projects like LACIE and the Landsat program.
  - Now I am a big supporter of women in STEM fields, like the one i worked in at
    NASA.
  - This is because there are simply too few women in STEM fields.
  - But there are and were so many women working in STEM that proved it isn't just
    for men, like me.
  - Anyhow, would you like a small tour of the room?
