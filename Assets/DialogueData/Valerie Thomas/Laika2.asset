  dialogue:
  - This is Kudryavka, but better known as Laika.
  - Such a cute dog. She really showed that even female dogs can make great leaps
    forward.
  - Or in this case, great leaps upward.
  - Laika was the first living animal to go into orbit. Launched by the Soviets on
    October 4th, 1957.
  - Like most space dogs, she was a stray from Moscow.
  - Strays were chosen because they could easily adapt to diffucult situations.
  responses:
  - responseText: Such a good girl.
